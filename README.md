# Deep Learning Nanodegree
## Recurrent Neural Networks
## Project: Generate TV Scripts

## Project Overview
In this project, you'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons. The built Recurrent Neural Network will generate a new TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern).

## Getting the project files
Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/adityasaxena26/tv-script-generation.git
  cd tv-script-generation
  ```
Open the notebook.

  ```jupyter notebook Adi_tv_script_generation.ipynb```

  ## Software and Libraries
  - Download anaconda or miniconda.
  - Create a new conda environment:

    ```conda create --name dlnd python=3```

  - Enter your new environment:

    Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd

    Windows: >> activate dlnd

  - Ensure you have numpy, tensorflow and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:

    ```conda install numpy tensorflow jupyter notebook```

  - Run the following to open up the notebook server:

    jupyter notebook

  - In your browser, open Adi_tv_script_generation.ipynb
