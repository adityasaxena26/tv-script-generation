## Project: Generate TV Scripts

### Project Overview
In this project, I generated Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. For training the network, I made use of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons. The built Recurrent Neural Network generated a new TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern).

### Getting the project files
Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/adityasaxena26/tv-script-generation.git
  cd tv-script-generation
````
  - Run the following to open up the notebook server:
```jupyter notebook```

  - In your browser, open ```Adi_tv_script_generation.ipyn```

### Data
[Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons. The RNN will generate a new TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern).
